        <strong>Course:</strong> Computer Science Principles
        <br>
        <strong>Duration:</strong> Approximately two weeks in September 2019
        <br>
        <strong>Objective:</strong> To create an interactive game or story using Scratch.
        <br>
        <strong>Type of Project:</strong> Pair-programming
        <br>
        <br>
        Scratch is a coding platform that uses drag-and-drop blocks. Because this was our very first project, the goal of this project was to simply get an introduction to coding. We were instructed to pair program an interactive story or game that was then previewed by the class in a gallery walk fashion. My partner and I chose to create a interactive story about a dinosaur where the user would be able to choose what to feed the dinosaur as it ventures through different settings. We ran into a problem with figuring out how we could both efficiently work on the code as the platform did not allow two people to be working on the same project at once. However, we problem solved by assigning each partner a different role and communicating with each other to put the code together. I was in charge of coming up with the backgrounds, dialogue, and characters, while my partner was in charge of the backbone code which would be implemented throughout entire the project. This project taught me a lot about the importance of documentation on projects.

        <br>
        <strong>Course:</strong> Computer Science Principles
        <br>
        <strong>Duration:</strong> Approximately three weeks in October-November 2019
        <br>
        <strong>Objective:</strong> To create an app provided with a tutorial by MIT App Inventor and then customize its functions.

        <strong>Type of Project:</strong> Pair-programming

        MIT App Inventor is a platform for programmers to create apps, similarly with drag-and-drop blocks. This being only the second project in the class, we touched upon the very basics of coding an app. MIT App Inventor provided a list of tutorials and we were instructed to choose one. My partner and I chose to create a photobooth app that had a simple four canvas layout. We customized the app by adding a drawing/coloring ability on each photo you take. It was difficult getting the share feature to work properly, but luckily, we were able to comb through the code and figure out what needed fixing. I would say my partner and I equally not only worked on the creative aspect of the app, like the layout and color correcting, but also did our fair share of actually coding this project. This project really emphasized the importance of collaboration.
